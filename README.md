# Inspector's Gadget

## Introduction

Inspector's Gadget is a desktop GUI application that streamlines the process of
generating building inspection reports.

A building inspection report involves three things:

1. Photos taken of the building
2. Floor plan of the building
3. PDF report of all building defects and recommended actions taken (if any)

A building inspection report is done as follows: the engineer walks around the
building and takes photos of all structural features and defects (if any).

The engineer will then annotate the floor plan, showing where the defects are
in the building. Here's what that looks like:

The final report includes the annotated floor plan, the table of captioned
photos and final recommendations by the engineer.

Generating this final report manually is a very time-consuming process and this
application streamlines the process by 75%.

## Feature showcase

### Upload floor plan

The smart tagging feature shows you a preview of the photo while
you're tagging it so you don't need to switch windows.

### Move tag position

If you have made a mistake in placing a tag, simply right-click to
reposition the tag.

### Comment on building defects

You can work on mutiple projects at once and even have multiple versions of the
same project.
