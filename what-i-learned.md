# What I learned from this project

## Milestones
- My first native (read: .exe) app of significant complexity
- My first app that's used on a regular, daily basis, by a commercial
  organisation, for profit.

## Frameworks and libraries
- Rudimentary Vue.js (seems like I've only scratched the surface: haven't used
  components, only one big global object)
- Rudimentary Electron (main and renderer process, but didn't use the main
  process much)
- localForage (this is the first time I've had to store data locally)
- vex (non-blocking dialog boxes)

## Build tools
- Using webpack to build multiple source files
- How to create and import modules 

## Software engineering
- Packaging and releasing a piece of software (I used Github's releases
  function. This is also the first time I have created a JS Windows executable.
  For form-emailer I believe I used cxFreeze, for Python.)

## Things I already knew but got to practice
- HTML5 canvas
- Writing clean code and refactoring
- Splitting up code into different files
- Working with promises
- Working with the file system

## My thoughts
- I have spent about 100 hours on this project at this point; it should be
  (more or less) feature complete
- I really enjoy the idea of building software that helps someone streamline
  their workflow
- It's a good feeling to know that your software is being used by users
- I also like the feeling of being able to create a piece of software all the
  way from ideation to production; it gives me a sense of accomplishment
